# Machine_Learning_Model_Deployment_with_Streamlit
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to explore the Wine Quality dataset, visualize data distributions and correlations, predict wine quality based on input features using a trained machine learning model, and evaluate model performance with classification reports and confusion matrices.
